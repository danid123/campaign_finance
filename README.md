We've done a few hack days and we meet weekly at the [Code for America Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/) on Wednesdays from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. We're currently working in Python and D3 using MongoDB to run queries (but we also have CSV and JSON files if you prefer).

We're looking for help hacking the election!
